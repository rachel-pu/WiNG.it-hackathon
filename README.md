# WiNG.it

Welcome to WiNG.it, a project brought to life by a group of first-time hackers at the University of Florida's inaugural WiNGHacks event. This hackathon is designed to empower Women, Nonbinary, and Gender minorities by providing them with a platform to innovate and create.

## 🏆 Achievement

We are thrilled to announce that WiNG.it won the **First Flight Award** at WiNGHacks! This award recognizes the best project created by first-time hackers.

## About WiNGHacks

WiNGHacks is the first annual hackathon event at UF that focuses on uplifting Women, Nonbinary, and Gender minorities. It aims to provide a supportive environment where these groups can thrive and showcase their technological skills.
